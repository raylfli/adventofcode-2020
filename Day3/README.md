# Part 1
You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?

# Part 2
Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

- Right 1, down 1.
- Right 3, down 1.
- Right 5, down 1.
- Right 7, down 1.
- Right 1, down 2.

What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?
