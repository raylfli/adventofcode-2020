# Part 1
The pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z), there exists a single cube which is either active or inactive.
The homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses ((...)). Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the expression inside must be evaluated before it can be used by the surrounding expression. Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.

However, the rules of operator precedence have changed. Rather than evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the same precedence, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order in which they appear.

Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what is the sum of the resulting values?

# Part 2
Now, addition and multiplication have different precedence levels, but they're not the ones you're familiar with. Instead, addition is evaluated before multiplication. 

What do you get if you add up the results of evaluating the homework problems using these new rules?
