# Part 1
In this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:

If that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.
Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.

Given your starting numbers, what will be the 2020th number spoken?

# Part 2
Given your starting numbers, what will be the 30000000th number spoken?

(The game otherwise remains the same.)
